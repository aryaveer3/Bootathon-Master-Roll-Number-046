In this project we<br />developed a machine learning model to detect various vehicles and classify them in real time. We used<br />technologies like tensorflow for this project. We were able to get an appreciation prize and wining<strong><br /></strong>amount for this.<strong><br /><br></strong></li>
		<li>Smart Car Parking System Using Arduino:<br /><br>We have made a car parking system in which no manual work is to be done. When any car will come at<br />the gate, the barricade will open and the screen will display the name of slot(s) available to park your<br />vehicle. By the use of algorithms, the nearest slot available will be displayed. When all the slots are full,<br />the barricade will not open.<strong><br /><br></strong></li>
